cd Terminal-Game-Engine
'''

Create a build directory and run CMake:

'''bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
'''

Notes:
- Make sure your environment paths include any required DLLs on Windows (e.g., SDL3, GLFW).
- EngineCore is built as a shared library and automatically linked to EngineGUI.
- You can add your own runner by creating a new executable that links to EngineCore if needed.
